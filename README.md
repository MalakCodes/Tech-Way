# Tech Way

Tech Way is a personal project created by *Malak* and *Reem* as part of their journey in learning Full Stack Web Development.

## Project Idea
The goal of Tech Way is to help beginners discover the tech field that best matches their personality and interests.  
After answering a set of carefully designed questions, users receive:  
- A recommended tech path  
- A list of suggested courses to start learning that path  

This project also serves as a hands-on opportunity for the developers to apply what they have learned.

## Current Phase
- Focus on *Front-End Development*  
- Building the user interface and the recommendation system

## Future Plans
- Add *Back-End functionality*  
- Integrate data analysis for more accurate recommendations  
- Introduce advanced features and more personalized learning paths

## First Release
The first version of Tech Way is now live:
